### Ignoring the fundamental problems of modern physics theories is the main obstacle to development

#### Theory of relativity

The theory of relativity predicts the contracted measured length of objects moving with relativistic velocity relative to any inertial reference frame. However, this contradicts experimental data in certain cases, since it requires either superluminal motion or the absence of contraction of the measured length. Experimentally, in these cases, the absence of contraction of the measured length of objects will be recorded. Briefly:[[UnsolvedTwinParadoxLight.en#Relativity and two linear arrays of detectors|Relativity and two linear arrays of detectors]]. Details:[[UnsolvedTwinParadoxLight.en#The general basis for the special theory of relativity and for quantum mechanics. What is interference physically really like|The general basis for the special theory of relativity and for quantum mechanics. What is interference physically really like]]. This proves that there is only one absolute frame of reference.

The dipole anisotropy of the microwave background radiation proves our motion relative to the absolute reference frame. Different inertial frames of reference have different time dilation and the observed picture of the universe. The same actions in different inertial frames of reference, which move at different relativistic speeds relative to the absolute frame of reference, will lead to different results. The frontal part of a relativistic spacecraft (relative to the absolute reference frame or the Earth, that is, almost relative to the center of the universe) will detect more surrounding photons than the rear one.

The theory of relativity predicts the dynamics of galaxies, which is fundamentally different from the experimental data. To compensate for this discrepancy, the concept of dark matter was invented. However, the scientific community has not been able to experimentally detect either dark matter particles or any other traces, for example, microlensing of radiation passing near dark matter. This proves that the concept of deformation of space-time by mass is erroneous, and the source of gravity are particles - a quantum gravitons.

The dynamics of Blazars does not correspond to the predictions of the theory of relativity, but it is in good agreement with the concept of uneven emission of quantum gravitons. Details:[[theoryofeverything.en#Irregularity of gravity. Quantum graviton. Blazar - SMBH with relativistic jets|Irregularity of gravity. Quantum graviton. Blazar - SMBH with relativistic jets]].

#### Deformation of space

The concept of deformation of space by mass contradicts experimental data on the dynamics of galaxies, Blazars, and minor changes in mass during the merger of black holes or other objects at a tremendous distance from LIGO-type detectors. There is no dark matter experimentally. Relativistic Blazar jets should not exist experimentally, based on the theory of relativity. LIGO detects a very small change in mass at a distance of billions of light-years, and the deformation of space is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. At the same time, objects that lose significant mass at a distance of several orders of magnitude less are not detected. This indicates that we are not detecting a deformation of space, but a colossal release of quantum gravitons in a very short period of time. Details:[[theoryofeverything.en#Irregularity of gravity. Quantum graviton. Blazar - SMBH with relativistic jets|Irregularity of gravity. Quantum graviton. Blazar - SMBH with relativistic jets]], [[theoryofeverything.en#Dark matter|Dark matter]].

#### Discreteness of space-time

All the experiments conducted to find the discreteness of space-time when detecting light from the most distant stars and galaxies did not reveal any discretization of space-time. In the case of space-time discreteness, particles must jump between the nodes of a three-dimensional grid in a quantum of time. This should be detected experimentally, but all the results are negative. It is worth noting that the required accuracy threshold for Planck length and time has been exceeded by many orders of magnitude, but no discreteness has been detected. Details:[[theoryofeverything.en#Continuity of space and time|Continuity of space and time]].

#### Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory

Probabilities are just the consequences of conducting a series of experiments with different initial and external conditions. This means that quantum computers based on probabilistic principles cannot solve all possible variants of a problem at the same time and are solvers of approximate problems with approximate values at all stages, which leads to unpredictable solutions with a complete lack of understanding of how this solution is obtained. It's like adding noise operators to solving problems on classical computers. Details:[[OnTheNon-probabilisticNatureOfTheUniverse.en|On the non-probabilistic nature of the universe]], [[theoryofeverything.en#Fate and probability|Fate and probability]], [[theoryofeverything.en#Schrodinger's Cat|Schrodinger's Cat]].

Half-plane diffraction proves that there are no waves, since vacuum experimentally is not a source of secondary re-emission. Waves in antiphase are not experimentally neutralized. As a result, all the effects are caused by the dynamics of particles and their interaction or re-emission by atoms from the half-plane, lenses, polarizers and other obstacles.

#### The Standard Model of particles

Transformations of the particles of the Standard Model prove their nonelementarity. Details:[[theoryofeverything.en#All elementary particles = quantum photons and quantum gravitons. What the elements of the Standard Model consist of. The disintegration of everything in the universe|What are the particles of the Standard Model consist of?]], [[theoryofeverything.en#Irregularity of gravity. Quantum graviton. Blazar - SMBH with relativistic jets|Quantum graviton]], 

#### Stability of elementary particle systems

A stable particle system does not emit anything. No photons. No gravitons. This means that there is no stability of the proton and almost all particles of the Standard Model. Details:[[theoryofeverything.en#All elementary particles = quantum photons and quantum gravitons. What the elements of the Standard Model consist of. The disintegration of everything in the universe|What are the particles of the Standard Model consist of?]], [[theoryofeverything.en#Stability of elementary particle systems|Stability of elementary particle systems]], [[theoryofeverything.en#Stable systems do not emit anything.|Stable systems do not emit anything]], [[theoryofeverything.en#Particle stability. Proton-proton cycle. Neutron decay|Proton structure]].

#### Big Bang Inflation

The concept of Big Bang inflation should stretch space evenly, which means that the particles will be distributed evenly throughout the entire volume of space. Then it is impossible to form galaxies in such a short time. Therefore, the theory of inflation is wrong. Details:[[theoryofeverything.en#Time since the Big Bang|No Big Bang Inflation]]

#### String theory

There is no correspondence between string theory and experimental data. Any theory that is not related to reality is nothing more than a fantasy.
